     * Given a string s and a string t, check if s is subsequence of t.
     * <p>
     * You may assume that there is only lower case English letters in both s and t. t is potentially a very long (length ~= 500,000) string, and s is a short string (<=100).
     * <p>
     * A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).
     * <p>
     * Example 1:
     * s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
     * <p>
     * Return true.
     * <p>
     * Example 2:
     * s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
     * <p>
     * Return false.
     *
